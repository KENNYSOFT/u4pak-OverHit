u4pak-OverHit
=====

Unpack, list, and test Unreal Engine 4 OverHit .pak archives.

Basic usage:

    u4pak.py list <archive>                 - list contens of .pak archive
    u4pak.py test <archive>                 - test archive integrity
    u4pak.py unpack <archive>               - extract .pak archive
    u4pak.py pack <archive> <files>         - create .pak archive

Only archives of version 4 is supported.

This script is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3 (tested with 2.7.5 and 3.3.2).

If you get errors saying anything about `'utf8' codec can't decode byte [...]` try to
use another encoding by passing `--encoding=iso-8859-1` or similar.

If you get an error message about an illegal file magic try to pass `--ignore-magic`.
If you get an error message about the archive version not being 4 try to pass
`--force-version=4`.

File Format
-----------

Only what is absolutely necesarry to read archives is reverse engineered.

Byte order is little endian and the character encoding of file names seems to be
ASCII (or ISO-8859-1/UTF-8 that coincidentally only uses ASCII compatiple
characters).

Offsets and sizes seem to be 64bit or at least unsigned 32bit integers. If
interpreted as 32bit integers all sizes (except the size of file names) and offsets
are followed by another 32bit integer of the value 0, which makes me guess these
are 64bit values. Also some values exceed the range of signed 32bit integers, so
they have to be at least unsigned 32bit integers. This information was reverse
engineered from the Elemental [Demo](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Linux_Demos)
for Linux (which contains a 2.5 GB .pak file).

Basic layout:

* Data Records
* Index
  * Index Header
  * Index Records
* Footer

In order to parse a file you need to read the footer first. The footer contains
an offset pointer to the start of the index records. The index records then
contain offset pointers to the data records.

### Record

    Offset  Size  Type         Description
         0     8  uint64_t     offset
         8     8  uint64_t     size (N)
        16     8  uint64_t     uncompressed size
        24     4  uint32_t     compression method:
                                  0x00 ... none
                                  0x01 ... zlib
        28    20  uint8_t[20]  unknown
        48    20  uint8_t[20]  data sha1 hash
    if compression method != 0x00
        68     4  uint32_t     block count (M)
        72  M*16  CB[M]        compression blocks
    end
         ?     1  uint8_t      is encrypted
       ?+1     4  uint32_t     compression block size

### Compression Block (CB)

Size: 16 bytes

    Offset  Size  Type         Description
         0     8  uint64_t     start offset:
                               Absolute offset of the start of the compression block.
         8     8  uint64_t     end offset:
                               Absolute offset of the end of the compression block.
                               This may not align completely with the start of the
                               next block.

### Data Record

    Offset  Size  Type            Description
         0     ?  Record          file metadata (offset field is 0, N = (if encrypted) ceiling(compressed_size / 16) * 16 (else) compressed_size)
         ?     N  uint8_t[N]      file data

### Index Record

    Offset  Size  Type            Description
         0     4  uint32_t        file name size (S)
         4     S  char[S]         file name
       4+S     ?  Record          file metadata

### Index

    Offset  Size  Type            Description
         0     4  uint32_t        mount point size (S)
         4     S  char[S]         mount point
       S+4     4  uint32_t        record count (N)
       S+8     ?  IndexRecord[N]  records

### Footer

Size: 52 bytes

    Offset  Size  Type         Description
         0     4  uint32_t     magic: 0x5A6F12E1
         4     4  uint32_t     version: 4
         8     8  uint64_t     patch version
        16     8  uint64_t     index offset
        24     8  uint64_t     index size
        32    20  uint8_t[20]  index sha1 hash
